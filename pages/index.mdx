# Welcome to Glyphx documentation

Here you will find everything you need to know about developing and using Glyphx. Whether you are a consultant working on onboarding clients or a developer looking to make your first contribution, this is the central source of truth for up to date documentation and resources.

## Stack Overview

- React v.18.0.2 (Frontend)
- TailwindCSS v3.0.15 w/ autoprefixer (Styling)
- Next.js v12.2.5 (Framework)
- Recoil v0.7.5 (State Management)
- Cypress (Testing)
- AWS Amplify (Graphql backend)
- qtwebchannel v5.9.0 (Qt Message Bus / Interface)

## Key libraries

- React DnD (low-level drag and drop)
- date-fns (stripped down date handling)
- fuse.js (fuzzy search)

## Recoil State Management

Recoil was developed for the needs of the facebook team working on an application which had a number of similar requirements to Glyphx.

- Lots on interactivity
- State persistance via shareable links
- Lots of settings affecting many queries that are combined on the client
- Lots of functionality that will reuire external plugins and APIs

Hits limitations of existing state mgmt libraries rather quickly and hinders velocity

### Key benefits

#### Flexible shared state

    - Have different components in sync at disparate parts of the react tree

#### Derived state & queries

    - Allows you to change state logic quickly with minimal bugs (b/c modelled as pure functions)

#### App-wise state observation

    - Opens the door to time-travel debugging, state persistence, undo support, logging which are difficult to achieve otherwise
